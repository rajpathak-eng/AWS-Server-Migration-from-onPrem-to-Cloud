**Project Goal:**

In this project, my mission was to tackle a complex challenge: migrating 7 to 8 SAP Application and Hana DB Servers from our on-premises infrastructure to the Cloud. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.

**The Challenge:**

**1. SAP Application Migration:** SAP systems are notoriously intricate, and moving them is like shifting a grand piano. We had to ensure a seamless transition, no data loss, and minimal downtime. 

**2. Hana DB Server Migration:** Handling a critical database like Hana required precision. Data integrity and performance were non-negotiable.

**3. Prior Migration Experience:** Fortunately, I brought prior experience to the table. I've successfully migrated various applications, servers, and even static websites to the Cloud in the past. I'm no stranger to the intricacies of these projects.

**4. Static Website Optimization:** As a bonus, we optimized our costs by moving static websites to AWS S3. This not only saved resources but also boosted our site performance.
