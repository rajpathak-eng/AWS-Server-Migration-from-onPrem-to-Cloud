# AWS Server Migration Project

## Project Overview

In this project, we successfully migrated 7 to 8 SAP applications and Hana DB servers from on-premises to the AWS Cloud. Our team has extensive experience in handling various migration projects, ranging from applications and servers to static websites, all with the goal of optimizing costs and enhancing performance.

## Project Details

### Challenge

One of the significant challenges we faced was migrating Hana servers with massive TB-sized data. During the migration process, we encountered data corruption issues when creating OVA files for server transfer.

### Solution

To overcome this challenge, we implemented a robust solution using AWS Server Migration services. This approach allowed us to migrate the servers seamlessly from on-premises infrastructure to the AWS Cloud. By doing so, we ensured data integrity and eliminated the risk of data corruption during the migration process.

## Key Benefits

- **Data Security**: The migration process was designed to maintain the security and integrity of your critical data.

- **Cost Efficiency**: Moving to the AWS Cloud can significantly optimize costs compared to traditional on-premises solutions.

- **Performance**: AWS provides scalability and performance improvements that enhance the overall efficiency of your SAP applications and Hana DB servers.
